        <h1>Career</h1>
        <p>
            Brit Bob's humble beginnings as an instant mega-star began in the Cretaceous period. The earliest known recordings of her works were found by Paleontologist and Dubstep enthusiast Justin Timberwood, who is credited with discovering the lyrics to "Oops.. The Times Are a-Changin" etched in a cave wall outside of Hollywood Boulevard. Her music has transceded the ages, but no one piece as definitively as "I'm Not a Girl, but not yet Knockin' on Heaven's Door" feat. Johnny Cash. Astonishingly, Brit Bob's career has never peaked, but rather started at the top of the charts and has increased quarterly at the curve of y = (x+1)^2.
